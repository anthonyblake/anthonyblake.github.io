I am an experienced Software Developer, Technical Manager, and Technical Architect, who has been working in the Dynamics space since around 2010. 

In 2002 graduated in Software Engineering at the University of Central Lancashire, becoming an ERP developer in the same year.

Recently my focus has been on Azure technologies with specific focus on technical designs of integrations between Dynamics 365 Finance and external systems and providers. 

I also gained the Power Platform Developer Associate certification from Microsoft in 2022.

For more information on my career see my [linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthonyblakedynamics/) 

My first blog post was in 2010, to make notes for my own reference when creating integrations in Dynamics AX 2009.

Currently, I write about anything that interests me, from Dynamics 365 Finance updates to Azure DevOps CI/CD how-to guides.
