The usage stats for the Dynamics 365 Finance APIs Postman workspace for September 2024 landed in my inbox this week, and the user numbers are more than I ever expected. When I created the workspace and posted the first update on a Saturday lunchtime a few months ago, I hoped it would be useful as a reference for members of the community, but in reality expected myself to be the biggest user. Like most of my community contributions, I created the Postman workspace to help future-me as much as anything. It became clear early on that there was exceptional community demand for working postman examples, and the user count quickly hit the 99+ limit in the postman app.

The stats for September are great, I'm delighted that so many members of the community are finding value in these API examples.
